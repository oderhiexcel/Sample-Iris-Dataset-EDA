# Iris Dataset EDA 
An in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis of the Iris dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook. 
 
## Overview 
This project explores the Iris dataset, consisting of 150 samples across three species (`Iris-setosa`, `Iris-versicolor`, `Iris-virginica`), with measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The analysis includes: 
- Histograms of feature distributions. 
- A correlation heatmap to identify relationships. 
- A pairplot to visualize feature relationships by species. 
- Box plots and violin plots to compare distributions across species. 
 
## Key Insights 
- Petal length and petal width are the most discriminative features, showing clear species separation and a strong correlation of 0.96. 
- Sepal length provides some differentiation, while sepal width exhibits significant overlap across species. 
 
## Files 
- `iris_eda.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis. 
- `iris_eda.html`: HTML export of the notebook for easy viewing (note: minor accessibility warning about missing alt text on images, to be addressed in future updates). 
- PNG files (`feature_distributions.png`, `correlation_matrix.png`, `pairplot.png`, `box_plots.png`, `violin_plots.png`): Saved visualizations.
